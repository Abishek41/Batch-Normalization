    "1. Explain the concept of batch normalization in the context of Artificial Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Batch normalization is a technique used to improve the training process and overall performance of the network. The main idea behind batch normalization is to normalize the intermediate activations of a neural network layer during the training process. Normalization involves transforming the input data so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\n",

    "3. Discuss the working principle of batch normalization, including the normalization step and the learnable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Batch normalization is like having a helpful assistant for a group of students (neural network) during training. This assistant ensures that each student's performance (activations) is well-balanced and consistent. It achieves this by normalizing the scores of each student in the group, making their average score zero and maintaining a consistent spread. Additionally, the assistant provides each student with special pencils (learnable parameters gamma and beta) to adjust their scores individually, based on what works best for them. This way, batch normalization makes the training process faster and more efficient, helping the network learn better and improve its performance."

    "3.1 Experiment with different batch sizes and observe the effect on the training dynamics and model performancer\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Experimenting with different batch sizes can indeed have a significant impact on the training dynamics and model performance. The batch size is a hyperparameter that determines the number of samples processed before updating the model's weights during each training iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Effect on Training Dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Larger Batch Size: A larger batch size tends to make each training iteration more computationally efficient, as more samples are processed together. However, with larger batch sizes, the model may take longer to converge as it updates the weights less frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Smaller Batch Size: Smaller batch sizes lead to more frequent weight updates, which can result in faster convergence. However, smaller batch sizes may also introduce noise in the gradient estimates, which can make the training process more noisy and lead to fluctuating loss curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Effect on Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Larger Batch Size: In some cases, larger batch sizes might result in better generalization performance due to the smoothing effect they have on the optimization process. \n",
    "\n",
    "B. Smaller Batch Size: Smaller batch sizes may improve generalization performance, especially when the dataset is relatively small. They can help the model escape sharp minima and find more robust solutions."
